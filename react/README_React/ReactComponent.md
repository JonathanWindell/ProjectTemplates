# React Core Components

This library contains a curated collection of high-impact, reusable React components. These components cover the essential UI and Layout requirements for modern applications, structured to ensure scalability and maintainability.

## Layout Components

### 1. Container
A structural wrapper component designed to ensure consistent padding, margins, and maximum width constraints across different application views.

### 2. Sidebar
A responsive vertical navigation menu used for managing application routing and providing access to primary modules.

## UI Components

### 3. Button
A standardized interactive element for triggering actions, form submissions, or navigation, capable of supporting multiple variants (primary, secondary, outline).

### 4. ErrorBoundary
A protective wrapper component that catches JavaScript errors in its child component tree, logging those errors and displaying a fallback UI instead of crashing the whole app.

### 5. LoadingSpinner
A visual indicator used to signal asynchronous operations or data fetching states, improving user experience during wait times.

### 6. Modal
A flexible dialog overlay for displaying critical information, forms, or confirmations that require immediate user focus and interaction.

### 7. Notification
A non-intrusive feedback component (often referred to as a toast) used to display transient success, error, or warning messages to the user.

### 8. Pagination
A navigation control set that allows users to browse through large datasets or lists by dividing content into discrete pages.

### 9. SearchBar
An input interface specifically designed to let users filter content or query the application's database efficiently.

### 10. Tabs
A navigation element that organizes content into distinct, switchable sections, allowing users to toggle between different views within the same context.
