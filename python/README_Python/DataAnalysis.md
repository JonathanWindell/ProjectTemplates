# Data Analysis Toolkit

This repository contains a suite of essential scripts for data manipulation, statistical visualization, and predictive modeling. These modules cover the fundamental requirements for extracting insights from datasets.

## Core Utilities

### 1. Data Loader (Pandas)
A fundamental utility for structured data manipulation. It handles CSV loading and provides immediate access to dataset previews (head/tail) for verification.

### 2. Linear Regression (Scikit-learn)
A predictive modeling component that analyzes relationships between independent and dependent variables to forecast trends.

## Visualization Components

### 3. Line Chart
A time-series visualization tool used to track changes in numerical variables over specific intervals.

### 4. Bar Chart
A categorical comparison tool designed to visualize the frequency or count of distinct data categories.

### 5. Scatter Plot
A relational graph used to identify correlations or patterns between two different numerical variables.

### 6. Correlation Matrix
A heatmap visualization that displays statistical relationships between multiple variables, highlighting positive or negative correlations.

### 7. Histogram
A distribution tool that groups data into bins to visualize the frequency and spread of a single numerical variable.

### 8. Box Plot
A statistical graph used to display data distribution through quartiles, useful for identifying outliers and understanding data symmetry.
