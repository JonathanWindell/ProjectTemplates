Dependencies for Data Analysis:
To use the various data analysis functions, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

Pandas: For handling and analyzing data.

Matplotlib: For creating various types of graphs and visualizations.

Seaborn: For creating more aesthetically pleasing and informative visualizations.

Scikit-learn: For applying machine learning algorithms like linear regression.

Installation Command:
To install all the necessary dependencies, you can use the following command in your terminal:

bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Expected Outputs:
Depending on the type of analysis and visualization you run, you can expect the following types of outputs:

Pandas: You will get tables or dataframes that display your data, for example, the first few rows of the dataset (data.head()).

Matplotlib & Seaborn: These will generate various types of graphs such as line charts, histograms, box plots, or scatter plots, depending on the function you call.

Scikit-learn: If you use linear regression or other machine learning models, you will get predictions or forecasts from the trained model.

Example Outputs:
First few rows of the dataset:

python
print(data.head())
Displays the first 5 rows of your CSV file or dataset.

Line chart: A graph showing how one numerical variable changes over another, e.g., time.

Histogram: A graph showing the frequency of different values in a numerical column.

Scatter plot: A graph showing the relationship between two variables.

Correlation matrix: A heatmap that shows the correlation between various numerical variables.

Linear regression: A model that makes predictions based on the data, resulting in a list of predictions.
