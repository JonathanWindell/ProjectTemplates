Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup

Overview

This guide explains how to use a Python script to scrape data from a webpage using the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries. The scraped data is extracted from HTML tables and saved into a CSV file.

Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4

How It Works

Fetch HTML Data: The script sends a request to a specified URL and retrieves the page content.

Parse HTML: The BeautifulSoup library is used to parse the HTML and locate the required table(s).

Extract Data: The script iterates through table rows (<tr>) and extracts relevant data from table cells (<td>).

Save to CSV: The extracted data is written to a CSV file for further use.

Usage

Update the script with the desired URL from which you want to scrape data.

Identify the specific table class or ID within the HTML source.

Run the script using:

python script.py

The data will be saved in a CSV file in the same directory as the script.

Notes

Ensure that the webpage allows web scraping and complies with its terms of service.

The script may need modifications depending on the structure of the target webpage.

If the webpage requires authentication, additional headers or cookies may be necessary.

Example Output

If the script successfully extracts data, it will generate a CSV file formatted as:

Column1, Column2, Column3
Value1, Value2, Value3
...

Modify the script to match the table structure of the webpage you are scraping.
