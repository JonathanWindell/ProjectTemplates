API and Database Integration

Overview

This project provides a generic framework for fetching data from an external API and storing it in a database. The implementation is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different APIs and database schemas.

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed before running the script. You can install them using:

pip install requests psycopg2

Components

APIClient

A generic API client class that handles API requests.

Initializes with a base_url and optional api_key.

Fetches data from a specified endpoint using HTTP GET requests.

DatabaseClient

A database client class to manage database connections and queries.

Establishes a connection to a PostgreSQL database.

Executes SQL queries and fetches results.

Commits transactions and closes connections properly.

DataFetcher

A class that integrates the APIClient and DatabaseClient to:

Retrieve existing data entries from the database.

Fetch new data from the API.

Store the fetched data into the database.

Usage

Set up API and Database Clients

Define your API base URL and key (if required).

Set up database credentials (dbname, user, password, host).

Initialize the Components

api_client = APIClient(base_url="https://example.com/api", api_key="your_api_key")
db_client = DatabaseClient(dbname="your_db", user="user", password="password", host="localhost")

Define Data Fetching Parameters

table_name = "your_table"
data_key = "data"
columns = ["column1", "column2", "column3"]
fetcher = DataFetcher(api_client, db_client, table_name, data_key, columns)

Fetch and Store Data

identifiers = ["ID1", "ID2", "ID3"]
endpoint = "/fetch_data"
params_template = {}
unique_column = "identifier"
fetcher.fetch_and_store_data(identifiers, endpoint, params_template, unique_column)

Notes

Ensure that the API and database structure align with the implementation.

Modify the column names and database queries to fit your specific dataset.

Always close database connections when done using db_client.close().

Example Output

If the script runs successfully, the database will be populated with new entries fetched from the API. Any duplicate or existing entries will be skipped.

Adapt the script as needed to fit different APIs and data sources.
