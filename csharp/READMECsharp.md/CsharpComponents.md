.NET Application Skeleton & Base Classes

Overview
This repository provides a structured skeleton and base classes for modern .NET applications. It includes components for entity management, repositories, service layers, event-driven architecture, logging, dependency injection, and testing utilities. The goal is to establish a solid foundation for scalable software development in C# using .NET Core.

Features
Base entity classes ensure consistent data structure across different components. The repository pattern facilitates efficient data access. A service layer centralizes business logic and abstracts interactions with data sources. Event-driven architecture enhances modularity and communication. Logging and error handling utilities improve debugging and monitoring. The factory pattern provides a flexible approach for object creation. Dependency injection through .NET Core streamlines the management of dependencies. Unit of Work pattern ensures transactional integrity and optimizes database interactions. Entity Framework Core integration simplifies database management and queries. RESTful API implementation enables structured HTTP communication. The mediator pattern reduces coupling between components and simplifies request handling. Testing utilities based on xUnit and Moq ensure reliability and maintainability of the system.

Installation
Start by cloning the repository using Git. Navigate to the project folder and open it in Visual Studio or VS Code. Restore dependencies using the dotnet restore command, ensuring all necessary libraries are available. Run the application using dotnet run to start execution.
Project Structure
Models store base entity and DTO classes. Data provides database context and repository implementations. Services contain business logic and service layer components. Events define the event-driven system structure. Controllers manage API endpoints and HTTP requests. Utils handle logging, error tracking, and helper functions. Tests contain unit and integration tests for validating functionality. Configurations manage dependency injection and application settings.

How to Use
Entity base classes define a structure with unique identifiers and timestamps for creation and updates. Repository interfaces provide common data operations, including retrieval, updating, and deletion. The service layer encapsulates business logic and interacts with the repository. API controllers expose functionalities through structured HTTP endpoints. Dependency injection ensures smooth management of dependencies within the application.

Testing Guide
The project is tested using xUnit and Moq. Running dotnet test executes all test cases to verify the stability of components. Example unit tests check entity initialization and default behavior. Mocking frameworks facilitate isolated testing of repositories and services. Integration tests confirm system-wide interactions and API functionality.
